# The old rover ðŸš€ðŸš™

ðŸš§ Work in progress

## To beagle and beyond!

## Setup
To run please ensure you have git and npm installed, clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/lanoid/red-mars.git` and  use `npm i` then `npm run testOnce` - this code will not get an interfaceâ€¦

## Decisions
- Provide a class that can interpret and execute every command.
- Use test runner to provide ordered input,
- Test methods that have less ambiguous side effects directly.


## Hardest Problem
- Naming my methods.
- Forgetting to reset the rover for 30 minutes, this broke the third command ðŸ¤ª.

## The future
- Provide an interface, perhaps a grid highlighting the position of the rover.
- Itâ€™s hard to say whether an interface would be necessary, this application appears to be intended to remotely operate the rover - feedback from the rover (on mars) is likely to be highly asynchronous.
- One interface could allow a path to be selected for a given rover, then display the location of the rover as and when the rover moves to your desired location, this could be achieved by the rover sending itâ€™s current reference after completing a movement.
- Parse the instructions as originally given - with a managing function.
- Get the X & Y axis right the first time (I have had to constantly ðŸ‘‰ for Left and Right).
